# Domain Names 🌐

You have already built and deployed your own personal website — something that looks [like this](https://rag.hu/).

Notice the URL of this site above— `https://rag.hu `.  ` rag.hu ` is a domain name. In a URL, the part that comes after the "http://" or "https://" and before the path is called the domain name:

(from [MDN's What is a URL?](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Common_questions/What_is_a_URL))


A domain name is usually comprised of:

- A **top-level domain (TLD)**.
  - For `www.example.com`, the TLD is "com".
  - For `en.wikipedia.org`, the TLD is "org".
  - For `rag.hu`, the TLD is "hu".
    
- A **primary domain**, immediately to the left of the TLD. 
  - For `www.example.com`, the primary domain is "example".
  - For `en.wikipedia.org`, the primary domain is "wikipedia".
  - For `rag.hu`, the primary domain is "rag".

- **Subdomains**, to the left of the primary domain.
  - For `www.example.com`, the subdomain is "www".
  - For `en.wikipedia.org`, the subdomain is "en".
  - For `rag.hu`, there is no subdomain. (When there's no subdomain, it's known as the **apex domain**.)

When you deploy your personal website or final project, what domain do you want it to live at?

A standard `.com` domain name costs approximately $10/year. (If the name you want is already taken, however, then you first have to buy it from the current owner, which could cost [anything](https://www.godaddy.com/garage/the-top-20-most-expensive-domain-names/). **Let’s avoid that for now and only look for domain names which have not yet been registered by anyone**.)

Domains from other TLDs can cost more or less — for example, `.ai` domains cost approximately $70/year.

If you can’t find a `.com` that you like, `.dev` is a relatively new TLD (and therefore lots of names are still unregistered) that works well for technical folks’ personal websites and projects.

There are many tools out there to come up with ideas for domain names and to check domain availability — try [Instant Domain Search](https://instantdomainsearch.com/) or [domainr](https://domainr.com/). Try to find two or three candidates that you like.

But, when you find a name you like, go to [porkbun.com](https://porkbun.com/) and check how much it costs. Porkbun is my preferred **domain registrar**, and typically has the lowest prices. But you can also check [namecheap.com](https://www.namecheap.com/) or [gandi.net](https://www.gandi.net/), two other domain registrars, if you can’t find the name that you want on Porkbun.
